# 03 JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

In this assignment, I wrote the three functions of collectEmployees, displayAverageSalary, and getRandomEmployee. The collectEmployees function prompts the user three times for first name, last name, and salary. It also adds those values to an employee object and stores that object in an array. The displayAverageSalary adds the salary of all employees, averages them, and displays that result in the console. The getRandomEmployee selects a random employee from the array and prints them to the console.
